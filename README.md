# caveman

 - [ ] Fetch a list of venues from endpoint.
 - [ ] Render the result as a list
 - [ ] Make list items clickable linking to a detail view of the venue.
 - [ ] Add a map to the detail view with a marker indicating the venues position.

We expect that you will spend ~4 hours on this assignment.

## Hints

 - Use plain css or inline styles to make it look nice.
 - Preferably use these libs:
 - `whatwg-fetch` for fething stuff
 - `react-google-maps` for rendering the map
 - This README is intentionally light on info as to not limit the scope of the assignment. However, as ever when the project requirements are too light, we want you to request more information where needed.
