# Caveman

The purpose of this assignment is to showcase your skills in building robust UI
components with React.

The goal is to create a Button and a Dropdown component, from scratch. Checkout
the included images `button.png` and `dropdown.png`. The design is deliberately
shallow in a couple of aspects, it's your job to fill in these blank spaces. 

Use only inline styling. 

Make sure to create "reuseable" components with a well crafted api. 

The components should work as expected both in a desktop and mobile environment. 

We don't need to tell you how a button should be more than just an onClick
event. 

## Tips

At Universal Avenue we appreciate functional programming, we are especially fond
of the concept of functional composition when it comes to React components. So
much, in fact, that we created `react-compose` to make this easier.

In closing, small encapsulated pieces of logic that make sense in a larger
context is the way to impress us.
