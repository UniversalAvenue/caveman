 - [ ] Fetch a list of venues from endpoint.
 - [ ] Render the result as a list
 - [ ] Make list items clickable linking to a detail view of the venue.
 - [ ] Add a map to the detail view with a marker indicating the venues position.

## Hints

Use plain css or inline styles to make it look nice. (Add a style guide to this?)
Preferably use these libs:
`whatwg-fetch` for fething stuff
`react-google-maps` for rendering the map
