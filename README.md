# Caveman

This project will showcase your React skills specifically and Frontend skills in general. We appreciate testable code that is clean and easy to read. The tasks below can be thought of as a guideline rather than a strict requirement. If you have a great idea about something cool to build, go ahead. 

We estimate that you will spend no more than a couple of hours on this assignment.

## Tasks

 - [ ] Fetch a list of venues from endpoint.
 - [ ] Render the result as a list
 - [ ] Make list items clickable linking to a detail view of the venue.
 - [ ] Add a map to the detail view with a marker indicating the venues position.

## Bonus

 - [ ] Make the detail view editable (there is a /:id endpoint for PUT)

## Hints

 - Use plain css or inline styles to make it look nice. (Do spend time on making careful design decisions and writing a slim set of styles)
 - Preferably use these libs:
 - `whatwg-fetch` for fetching stuff
 - `react-google-maps` for rendering the map
 - We use the javascript styleguide that was [outlined by Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
 - This README is intentionally light on info as to not limit the scope of the assignment. However, as ever when the project requirements are too light, we want you to request more information where needed. 

## Turning it in

Just fork this repo and create a pull request.

When reviewing the code we will look for the following:

 - Is the code clean and straight forward
 - Is functionality properly encapsulated
 - Are there *useful* unit tests
 - Is the styling appropriate from a design/UX perspective
