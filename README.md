The purpose of this assignment is to showcase your skills in building robust UI
components with React.

The goal is to create a Button and a Dropdown component, from scratch. Checkout
the included images `button.png` and `dropdown.png`. The design is deliberately
shallow in a couple of aspects, it's your job to fill in these blank spaces. 

Use only inline styling. 

Make sure to create "reuseable" components with a well crafted api. 

The components should work as expected both in a desktop and mobile environment.
